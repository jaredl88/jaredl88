This creates a bucket, lambda function, dyanmodb table, a bucket event trigger, and the permissions. Once a .json is uploaded with id, firstname, and lastname into the bucket it will trigger the lambda function to put its contents into the dynamodb table with id as the key. The code in the zip file was taken from https://github.com/jspruance/cloudpath-tutorials/tree/master/aws-serverless/aws-s3-lambda-tutorial.
